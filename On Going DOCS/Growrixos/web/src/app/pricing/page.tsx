const FAQ = [
  { question: "Do you require an advance payment?", answer: "For qualifying international clients, we do not require an advance payment on the first 100 projects. Other scopes can use milestone-based terms when that fits better." },
  { question: "Can we choose a different payment arrangement?", answer: "Yes. We are flexible about payment structure and can tailor installments or milestones to the project as long as the arrangement stays fair for both sides." },
  { question: "Can we pay monthly?", answer: "Yes - Product Partner engagements are monthly, and custom scopes can also be broken into agreed installments." },
  { question: "What about scope changes?", answer: "We re-estimate transparently. Small changes flow through; significant additions are scoped as a change request." },
  { question: "Do you offer payment plans?", answer: "Yes. Payment plans are available when the scope and delivery model justify them, especially for larger ready-website or custom engagements." },
  { question: "What support is included after launch?", answer: "Every delivered site comes with 1 year of free support and maintenance, including bug fixes, security updates, and minor content updates." },
