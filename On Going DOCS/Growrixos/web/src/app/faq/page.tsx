const QUESTIONS: { category: string; question: string; answer: string }[] = [
  { category: "services", question: "What services do you offer?", answer: "Premium websites, HTML business profiles, SaaS applications, mobile app launch experiences, and ready websites. MCP servers and automation support those core offers when needed." },
  { category: "services", question: "How do projects typically start?", answer: "A 30-minute discovery call, followed by a written plan within 48 hours. Nothing is signed until the plan reads correctly to you." },
  { category: "services", question: "Will I own the code and assets?", answer: "Yes. On project completion, code, design files, and infrastructure ownership transfer to you." },
  { category: "pricing", question: "Do you require an advance payment?", answer: "For qualifying international clients, we can offer delivery-first payment with no advance on the first 100 projects." },
  { category: "pricing", question: "Can we choose a payment arrangement?", answer: "Yes. We are flexible and can tailor milestones, installments, or custom arrangements to the scope." },
  { category: "pricing", question: "Can we pay monthly?", answer: "Yes - Product Partner work is monthly, and larger scopes can also be split into agreed installments." },
  { category: "shop", question: "What comes with a ready website?", answer: "A launch-ready build, setup or handoff notes, and 1 year of free support and maintenance for bugs, security updates, and minor content changes." },
  { category: "shop", question: "Do shop products include support?", answer: "Yes. Website templates, HTML business profiles, and ready websites include setup guidance plus 1 year of support and maintenance." },
  { category: "shop", question: "How do updates work?", answer: "Support and maintenance are included for the first year. After that, you can continue with an ongoing package or keep the delivered version as-is." },
  { category: "booking", question: "How long is the discovery call?", answer: "30 minutes by default. We can extend to 60 minutes for complex projects on request." },
  { category: "booking", question: "What time zones do you cover?", answer: "Primary CET hours, with availability for North American mornings and South Asian afternoons." },
  { category: "booking", question: "Do you sign NDAs?", answer: "Yes — happy to sign a mutual NDA before the discovery call when needed." },
  { category: "support", question: "Do you support after launch?", answer: "Yes. Every delivered site includes 1 year of free support and maintenance, and longer-term retainers are available after that." },
  { category: "support", question: "What's your response time?", answer: "Inquiries: under 2 business hours. Retainer support: SLA-backed and defined per engagement." },
  { category: "support", question: "Can you fix work from another team?", answer: "Yes. We frequently audit and rebuild on top of existing engagements with a clear assessment first." },
  { category: "technical", question: "What stack do you prefer?", answer: "Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and headless CMS setups like Strapi or Sanity are our defaults for websites. For products, we layer in the backend and infra that fit the roadmap." },
  { category: "technical", question: "Where do you deploy MCP servers?", answer: "Cloudflare Workers, Fly, Vercel, or your AWS - when MCP is part of the roadmap, we adapt to your infra preferences and security posture." },
  { category: "technical", question: "How do you handle data and privacy?", answer: "We follow GDPR-style baselines: minimal collection, encrypted at rest, scoped access, and clear retention." },

const QUICK = [
  { question: "How fast can we launch a website?", answer: "Ready websites can move fastest. Custom websites usually land in 4-10 weeks depending on content and approvals." },
  { question: "Do you work with our team?", answer: "Yes — we frequently embed alongside in-house teams as a product pod." },
  { question: "How do payments work?", answer: "Flexible terms are available, and qualifying international clients can use a no-advance delivery-first model." },
