# Agency SaaS Website UI Architecture

## AI Consumption Guidance
- AI first-stop file for this folder: ai-context.yaml.
- Human index for this folder: README.md.
- Read this file when defining route structure, shared journeys, conversion paths, and cross-page dependencies.
- Do not read every page file before implementation; use ai-context.yaml and README.md to select only the relevant page plans.

## Product Intent
- Build a premium SaaS-style web presence for a web development agency that sells high-trust custom services and productized digital assets.
- Position the agency as a product-minded technical partner for SaaS applications, websites, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and automation systems.
- Support direct conversion paths for discovery, consultation, AI-assisted qualification, WhatsApp escalation, and Stripe-powered commerce.

## Recommended Experience Direction
- Visual theme: editorial-premium meets product dashboard.
- Default mood: light-first, high-contrast, warm-neutral surfaces with controlled teal and copper accents.
- Brand personality: precise, technical, modern, calm, high-trust.
- Mobile posture: app-like, thumb-friendly, fast-scanning, persistent utility access.

## Experience Principles
- Lead with proof before complexity: show outcomes, shipped work, and product depth quickly.
- Make the agency feel operational, not just promotional: expose process, stack, delivery system, and response speed.
- Keep every conversion path visible: book, chat, WhatsApp, and buy should remain close to the user at all times.
- Let the site behave like a lightweight product: sticky utilities, live assistant, saved filters, and sheet-based mobile actions.
- Treat the shop as a serious revenue surface, not an afterthought.

## Core Journeys
- New prospect: Home -> Services -> Service Detail -> Book Appointment.
- Product buyer: Home or Shop -> Product Detail -> Checkout.
- Proof-seeking lead: Home -> Portfolio -> Case Study -> Contact or Book Appointment.
- Research-driven buyer: Home -> Blog -> Blog Post -> Book Appointment.
- Fast-answer visitor: Any page -> AI Chat Widget or AI Concierge -> WhatsApp or Booking.
- Mobile visitor: Landing section -> sticky bottom dock -> chat/shop/services/booking without hunting.

## Global Navigation Model
- Header links: Services, Shop, Portfolio, Blog, Pricing, About, AI Concierge.
- Persistent primary CTA: Book Appointment.
- Persistent secondary utilities: AI popup chat, WhatsApp, Cart.
- Footer groups: Services, Shop Categories, Insights, Company, Support, Legal.
- Deep-link behavior: every service card, case study teaser, and featured product routes to a detail surface.

## Mobile Navigation Model
- Bottom dock items: Home, Services, Shop, Portfolio, Chat.
- Sticky mobile action bar: Book, WhatsApp, Cart.
- Drawer menu for secondary pages: Pricing, About, Contact, FAQ, Legal.
- Mobile filters, cart, and chat use sheets or modal overlays instead of full-page interruptions where possible.
- The public shell must reserve bottom-safe space so footer trust and copyright content remain visible above fixed mobile utilities.

## Shared Conversion Infrastructure
- AI chat launcher pinned globally with a shared popup conversation surface and contextual prompts per page.
- Live chat entry for high-intent pages and support pages.
- WhatsApp CTA in header utility, mobile sticky action, AI fallback, and contact surfaces.
- Booking flow connected from hero sections, service pages, pricing, and AI escalation.
- Stripe checkout for template, ready-site, mobile app, and packaged MCP product purchases.

## Frontend Visual Strategy
- Hero sections combine editorial typography with product-like panels, motion traces, and code or workflow previews.
- Surfaces should feel layered: paper base, frosted panels, inset data wells, and elevated CTA cards.
- Imagery should mix shipped UI screenshots, technical workflow diagrams, and device mockups rather than generic stock photos.
- Repeating visual motif: blueprint lines, subtle grid overlays, and animated signal paths that imply systems integration.

## Layout System
- Desktop: 12-column grid, 72px outer margins on wide screens, 24px gutters.
- Tablet: 8-column grid, stacked content blocks, preserved proof modules.
- Mobile: single-column flow with sectional card grouping and sticky utilities.
- Max content widths: 1440px marketing shell, 1200px reading shell, 960px dense detail shell.
