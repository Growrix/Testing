# Shared System Contracts

**Contract-first blueprint for the Agency SaaS website.**

This document defines the canonical system surfaces, roles, domain entities, API contracts, integrations, and non-functional requirements that all specialized roles (frontend, backend, security, DevOps, QA) must follow.

## Quick Navigation

- **[AI-first entrypoint](#ai-context)**: `ai-context.yaml`
- **[System Architecture](#system-architecture)**: surfaces, roles, entities
- **[API Contract Index](#api-contracts)**: all endpoints
- **[Integration Inventory](#integrations)**: Stripe, WhatsApp, Calendar, Email, AI, Chat, Analytics
- **[Non-Functional Requirements](#nfr)**: performance, security, scalability
- **[Implementation Sequence](#phases)**: 5 phases from MVP to optimization

## System Overview

### Surfaces

The system consists of four distinct surfaces, each with specific purposes, routes, authentication requirements, and integrations:

1. **Public Marketing** (`/`, `/blog`, `/blog/[slug]`, `/services`, `/services/html-business-profiles`, `/portfolio`, `/pricing`, `/about`, `/faq`, `/contact`)
   - No auth required
   - Public browsing, service discovery, credibility proof
   - Read-only for public users

2. **Commerce** (`/shop`, `/shop/[slug]`, `/checkout`, `/html-business-profiles`)
   - Optional auth (browsing) or required (checkout)
   - Digital product sales (templates, HTML business profiles, MCP servers, ready websites, mobile apps)
   - Stripe payment integration
   - Order fulfillment

3. **Conversion** (`/book-appointment`, `/ai-concierge`, `/contact`, `/live-chat`)
   - No auth required
   - Booking inquiries, AI chatbot, contact forms, live support
   - Calendar, WhatsApp, Email, AI/LLM integration

4. **Admin** (internal only)
   - Auth required (admin role only)
   - Service and product management
   - Order and booking management
   - Analytics and settings

---

## Domain Entities & Lifecycle

- **Visitor**: unauthenticated user → discovers → engages → books or purchases
- **Subscriber**: registered user → receives communications → tracks orders/bookings
- **Customer**: completed transaction → accesses order history → potential repeat buyer
- **Service**: branded offering (SaaS, websites, HTML business profiles, MCP, automation) with pricing and support model
- **Product**: digital item for sale (template, HTML business profile, MCP, ready website, mobile app) with SKU and delivery
- **Project**: active custom service engagement with timeline and budget
- **Appointment**: booked consultation with status tracking

---

## Role Model

- **Public**: browse, initiate chat/booking, view shop (no checkout)
- **Subscriber**: public + email comms + inquiry tracking + order history
- **Customer**: subscriber + project access + support + reorder
- **Admin**: full access + manage content + view analytics

---

## Core Invariants

1. **All surfaces follow the same role and permission model** — no surface-specific role reinvention.
2. **Domain entities and lifecycle states are canonical** — defined here, inherited by all roles.
3. **API contracts and event payloads are explicit** — no backend invention allowed.
4. **Integrations are centrally managed** — not scattered across frontend or backend silos.
5. **Frontend must not invent server-backed behavior** — all server flows are defined in the contract.
6. **Backend must not invent UX-critical states** — all stateful flows are documented.

## API Contract Index

### Public Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/services`: list all services
- `GET /api/v1/services/[serviceId]`: service detail with pricing and messaging
- `GET /api/v1/portfolio`: list portfolio projects
- `GET /api/v1/portfolio/[slug]`: portfolio detail with images and testimonials
- `GET /api/v1/shop/categories`: product categories
- `GET /api/v1/shop/products`: list products with filters and pagination
- `GET /api/v1/shop/products/[productSlug]`: product detail with delivery info

### Conversion Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/appointments`: create booking inquiry
- `GET /api/v1/appointments/[appointmentId]`: retrieve appointment status
- `POST /api/v1/contact`: contact form submission
- `POST /api/v1/ai-concierge`: LLM chat query for FAQ/service questions
- `POST /api/v1/chat/start`: initiate live chat session

### AI Concierge Contract Rules

- The Ask the concierge CTA, launcher, and mobile chat entry open the shared popup chat surface first; the dedicated `/ai-concierge` route remains available as a full-page fallback and shareable destination.
- The concierge may answer only from approved internal Growrix content sources: services, pricing guidance, FAQs, portfolio proof, shop catalog, booking/contact instructions, and policy copy.
- The concierge must not use open-web browsing or unsupported model knowledge as a response source.
- If the request is outside approved knowledge, the concierge must return a bounded no-answer response and offer escalation to WhatsApp, booking, or contact.
- The backend owns grounding, prompt policy, lead qualification, and source attribution; the frontend owns chat rendering, composer state, and escalation UX.

### Commerce Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/orders`: create order (Stripe payment processing)
- `GET /api/v1/orders/[orderId]`: order status and delivery tracking
- `POST /api/v1/orders/[orderId]/download`: download digital product

### Subscriber Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/me`: current user profile
- `POST /api/v1/me/update`: update profile
- `GET /api/v1/me/orders`: order history
