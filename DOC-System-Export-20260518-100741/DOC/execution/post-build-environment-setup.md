# POST-BUILD ENVIRONMENT SETUP FLOW

## PURPOSE
Define the deterministic environment bootstrap that must run after code generation so local development starts with `npm run dev`.

## INPUTS
- `DOC/output/runs/<timestamp>/planning/plan.json`
- `DOC/output/runs/<timestamp>/codegen/` project root

## OUTPUT
- `DOC/output/runs/<timestamp>/reports/environment_setup_report.json`

## STEPS
1. Discover runtime project root and package manager from generated manifests.
   - If a frontend app exists at `web/`, treat `web/` as the runtime root for install/dev/build commands.
   - Root-level script shims may proxy commands, but setup must still validate execution from the real app root.
2. Ensure `package.json` exposes scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`.
3. Generate `ENV.example` from `plan.env_vars` if missing.
4. Create `.env.local` from `ENV.example` if missing (local placeholders only).
5. Validate env shape with runtime schema before server boot.
6. Install dependencies non-interactively using cache-first deterministic policy.
    - Compute install fingerprint from:
       1) package manager + version,
       2) lockfile hash,
       3) Node major/minor version,
       4) platform + architecture.
    - If `node_modules` exists and fingerprint matches the last successful setup, run lockfile verification and skip reinstall.
    - If fingerprint mismatches, verification fails, or cache marker is missing, run fresh install from runtime root.
    - On Windows, run clean reinstall fallback only when install fails with executable spawn/EPERM/UNKNOWN for native binaries (for example esbuild/swc/sharp):
       1) stop active `node`/`npm` processes,
       2) clear runtime root `node_modules` and lockfile,
       3) retry install once,
       4) if still failing, emit blocker with exact package and syscall.
7. Run database client generation and local migrations when configured.
8. Execute quality checks in order:
   - lint (zero warnings)
   - typecheck
   - test (unit/integration)
9. Start local dev server using `npm run dev` from the runtime root.
10. Run smoke probes for `/`, auth entry route, and `/api/health`.
11. Emit `environment_setup_report.json` with pass/fail per step and blocker details.
   - Report MUST include dependency setup mode: `cache_hit_skip | verified_install | clean_reinstall_fallback`.

## FAILURE HANDLING
- Missing required env vars: `ENV_SETUP_BLOCKED_MISSING_REQUIRED_ENV`
- Dependency or install failure: `ENV_SETUP_BLOCKED_INSTALL_FAILURE`
- Dependency binary lock/execution failure on Windows: `ENV_SETUP_BLOCKED_WINDOWS_BINARY_LOCK`
- Migration failure: `ENV_SETUP_BLOCKED_MIGRATION_FAILURE`
- Dev server boot failure: `ENV_SETUP_BLOCKED_DEV_SERVER_FAILURE`
- Smoke test failure: `ENV_SETUP_BLOCKED_SMOKE_FAILURE`

## RULES
- Do not commit `.env.local`.
- Do not invent env var names.
- Prefer deterministic non-interactive commands.
- If external credentials are unavailable, record exact placeholders and remaining manual steps.
